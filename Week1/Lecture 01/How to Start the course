Make sure you know the foundations of problem solving and coding in a couple of programming languages. 
Whether you have taken a data structures course or not, I encourage you to learn data structures and algorithms thoroughly. 
You donâ€™t have to be amazing in many programming languages, but you should be able to implement basic data structures without consulting external resources. 
Equally important, you should know when to use each data structure and the time complexity of basic operations.
