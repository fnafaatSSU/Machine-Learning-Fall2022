What is Github https://github.com/

is a website for storing and sharing code. A group of people can access the
same repositories (“repos”), editing code and then uploading or “pushing” these changes to the
repository for everyone to access.
Some repos are private: only the owner and any users specifically added by the owner can
access these repos.
Some repos are public: anyone who wants can access these repos. Most public repos are read
only unless you have been specifically added by the owner! You will be able to see the code, but
not edit it directly unless you make a copy yourself. We will talk about how to do this in a
minute!
