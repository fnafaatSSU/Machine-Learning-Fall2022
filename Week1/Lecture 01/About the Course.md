# About the Course
This course provides an introduction to machine learning algorithms. 
Machine learning is focused on finding patterns in data to solve complex problems.
# Machine learning
Instead of explicitly programming computers to perform a task, machine learning lets us program the computer to learn from examples and improve over time without human intervention. The course covers a broad cross-section of models and algorithms for machine learning. Topics include data preprocessing techniques, supervised learning algorithms, unsupervised learning algorithms, deep learning algorithms, and reinforcement learning algorithms. Four lecture hours per week.
