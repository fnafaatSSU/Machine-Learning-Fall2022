You should understand basic probability and statistics, (STA 107, 250), 
and college-level algebra and calculus. 
It is expected that you know about standard probability distributions (Gaussians, Poisson), 
and also how to calculate derivatives. 
In this class assume no python(it would be helpful if you know Python) or ML experience. However, experience with some programming language is required.
