# Google Colab

Colab is a product from Google Research, it allows anybody to write and execute arbitrary python code through the browser, and is especially well suited to machine learning, data analysis and education. More technically, Colab is a hosted Jupyter notebook service that requires no setup to use, while providing free access to computing resources including GPUs.

# How to Start Google Colab

To use it, you only need an internet connection and a Gmail account, since the codes are saved in Google Drive. This makes life much easier than using an IDE, although there are times when Colab may not be the most appropriate option, such as when web scraping. However, for data visualization and code documentation, it is the best choice.
