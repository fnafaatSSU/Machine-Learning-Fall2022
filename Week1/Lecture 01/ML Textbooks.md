Books that I love and recommend:
https://github.com/thiagordp/machine-learning-books

Tom Mitchell, Machine Learning, McGraw Hill, 1997.

Excellent book. Concise and well-explained. But it is quite old and does not cover recently developed concepts.

Some New Chapters are available

Mohri, Rostamizadeh, Talwalkar, Foundations of Machine Learning, MIT Press, 2nd edition, 2018.

Excellent book. Well-explained. Deep and mathematically rigorous. Suitable for mathematically inclined students.

Free PDF is available

Sutton & Barto, Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, MIT Press, 2nd edition, 2018.

Excellent book on reinforcement learning. Well-explained concepts with lots of examples. This provides a systematic view of multiple RL approaches.

For reinforcement learning, this is the book to read.
