# The plan for this week 
This week we will meet twice
Lecture #1
We will strat by explaining the overall goals and objectives of the course. This will give students a clear understanding of what they can expect to learn and what you hope they will take away from the class.

Provide an overview of the topics that will be covered in the course. This could include a list of the main chapters or units, as well as any major projects or assignments that will be completed.

Discuss the course schedule and format. This might include information on the frequency and duration of lectures, any required readings or outside assignments, and any other details that students need to know in order to stay on track.

Review any policies or expectations that you have for the class, such as attendance, participation, and grading criteria.

Offer an opportunity for students to ask questions or provide feedback on the syllabus. This can help to ensure that everyone is on the same page and has a clear understanding of the course expectations.Lecture #2
