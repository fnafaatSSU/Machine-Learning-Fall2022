# Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a field of computer science and artificial intelligence that deals with the development of algorithms and techniques that allow computers to learn and adapt based on data inputs. These techniques can be used to perform a variety of tasks, such as classifying email messages as spam or non-spam, or recognizing patterns in data. Machine learning algorithms can be trained using a set of labeled data examples and then applied to new, unseen data in order to make predictions or decisions. There are various ways in which machine learning can be defined, including from the perspective of artificial intelligence, software engineering, and statistics. The field has seen widespread application in a variety of contexts and has proven to be an effective means of solving complex problems that would be difficult to tackle using traditional programming methods.
